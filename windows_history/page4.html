        <h2>File System</h2>
        <p>
        The file structure of Windows is easy to follow and simple. Hard drives, CD-Drives, and any storage medium is assigned a drive letter, A through Z. The hard drive windows is installed on is usually called the C: drive. Any other storage medium or partition is assigned letters after the C drive (D: drive, E: drive, etc.). Within the storage medium are directories (commonly called folders) which are a way to organize and place your files.
