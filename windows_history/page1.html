        <h2>What is Windows?</h2> <!-- sub heading -->
        <p> <!-- makes paragraphs -->
        Windows is a series of operating systems developed by Microsoft and is the dominant operating system for personal computers. There have been many versions of Windows developed over the years. Some of them include Windows XP, Windows 7 and, the newest iteration, Windows 10.

        <h2>User Interface</h2>
        <p>
        The user interface of Windows has relatively stayed the same with certain features added here and there. The interface consists of a Desktop, where some of your files and shortcuts are put for your convenience, the Start menu, where all your applications are available to be launched from, the Taskbar, which gives you the ability to see which applications are open, pin shortcuts, see which applications are running in the background as well as see the status of certain features of the computer such as Wi-Fi and the battery life. Applications are usually opened in “windows” that can be resized, moved around the desktop, and minimized. This allows the user to have multiple applications open at the same time.
